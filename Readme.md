# [ECARE](https://ecare.exchange)
## Ethereum Combinatorial Auction Rate Exchange

#### ECARE, is an Ethereum Combinatorial Auction Rate Exchange meant to facilitate a self-sustaining ecosystem immune to bear-market volatility. 

### Motivation:

Bear markets are insufficient for public good tokens operating under Ethereum since ERC-20 tokens in their current forms are mostly used as investment contracts needing consistent investment to maintain their values.

ECARE tokens *(ERC-20 tokens using ECARE)* are not to be "bought and sold" but rather, only exchanged or "swapped" via AMMs (Automated Market Makers like Uniswap or an ECARE AMM). 

*Thus, ECARE token balances rise and maintain value based on exchange rates agreed upon further calcifying a self-sustaining token ecosystem absent of consistent investment.*

### Mechanics:

Unlike other exchange rate systems, ECARE's system isn't based on the market caps of the tokens, but is based solely on wallet balances and tokens. Thus, the mechanics that helps its tokens rise and maintain value are composed from its cross-pollination exchange system. 

#### Cross-pollination exchange system:

During exchanges, each token exchanged is moved into a burn wallet while the value of the tokens burned are exchanged into the corresponding wallet's balance as follows:

**Scenario 1:** *Wallet 1 exchanges 10 of their Tokens for 25 Tokens from Wallet 2.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Wallet 1                      | Wallet 2                      |
> | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | Balance = 100,000 USD         | Balance = 90,000 USD          |
> | Tokens = 100                  | Tokens = 90                   |
> | 1 Token = 1,000 USD           | 1 Token = 1,000 USD           |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Wallet 1                      | Wallet 2                      |
> | ----------------------------  | ----------------------------- |
> | Balance = 125,000 USD         | Balance = 100,000 USD         |
> | Tokens = 90                   | Tokens = 65                   |
> | 1 Token = 1,388.88 USD        | 1 Token = 1,538.46 USD        |

**Scenario 2:** *Wallet 1 exchanges 25.65 of their Tokens for 12.65 Token from Wallet 2.*

> ***Before Exchange***
> 
> | Wallet 1                      | Wallet 2                      |
> | ----------------------------  | ----------------------------- |
> | Balance = 125,000 USD         | Balance = 100,000 USD         |
> | Tokens = 90                   | Tokens = 65                   |
> | 1 Token = 1,388.88 USD        | 1 Token = 1,538.46 USD        |
> 
> ***After Exchange***
> 
> | Wallet 1                      | Wallet 2                      |
> | ----------------------------  | ----------------------------- |
> | Balance = 144,461.54 USD      | Balance = 135,625 USD         |
> | Tokens = 64.35                | Tokens = 52.35                |
> | 1 Token = 2,244.93 USD        | 1 Token = 2,590.73 USD        |
